## Introduction:

Mixology.io allows you to simply type the name of your favorite classic cocktail in the search bar and it will provide you with a list of ingredients, a recipe and instructional video on how to make that drink on your own. If the cocktail you are looking for is not available, you will be directed to try a different search.

## Why is this useful?

Mixology.io can be used by a variety of people; an average person throwing a dinner party might want to brush up on their drink knowledge in order ot be a better host, a bartender could use this application on the fly to look up drink their customers might order, or a student in a beverages class might use this search as a study tool to prepare for a parctical cocktail exam.
